So here is a useful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28249255/how-do-i-configure-github-to-use-non-supported-jekyll-site-plugins/28252200#28252200">tidbit</a> I came across while setting this whole thing up. I
suppose it is somewhat old news to some, however I am new to the <a href="https://pages.github.com">github pages</a>
game and haven't looked at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">jekyll</a> since 2010-ish. That last bit is entirely my
fault though, as I had left <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-land</a> at that point and was off in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">v8-world</a>
until recently. When I quit my job and moved back to the united states. Crazy
I know.

So after catching up on <a href="https://serialpodcast.org">serial</a>, and getting back in to drawing, I finally got
to the point where I could look at code again. It was here as previously
mentioned that I got heavily into emacs. Which admittedly was less for the
sake of blogging, and more because I had finally committed to get more than
a passing familiarity with <a href="https://common-lisp.net">cl</a>. Which meant spending time in emacs and <a href="https://github.com/slime/slime">slime</a>
and the more time I spent in emacs the more I found out it can <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TheKitchenSink">do</a>. This, I am
almost certain, is an age-old story of emacs addiction. I wonder if there is
a 12 step program for this?</p>
