So I have spent the last two weeks or so ripping parts out of <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> and learning about
minor mode creation and pretty much all the things I never never got around to checking
out. I think perhaps most of it was fear, and a little bit of lazy / lack of need /
want. A large part of this was due to <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> and how it just worked, and still works. It
just had fulfilled its purpose in being an introduction to the way things could be in
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Basically I had gotten tired of throwing stuff in my personal directory and had a growing
file of thigns to work around features of prelude or adding funcitnality. One day it was too
much and I set about figuring what parts of prelude did what and why. Much was learned about

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html">hooks</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advising</a> functions
</li>
<li>basic <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/core/prelude-mode.el">minor</a> mode creation
</li>
<li>some <a href="https://github.com/tonini/alchemist.el/blob/master/alchemist.el#L115">keymap</a> fun
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm sure there is much more, and that future posts will go into greater details.
For now though. Phew&#x2026;..
