So when I got started with this blog, I grabbed the first thing that I saw I liked and was
good to go, out of the box. That happened to be <a href="https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc">BlackDoc</a>. I did this mainly so I could experiment with Emacs
and blogging from it through <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, also I generally despise any 'front-end' work. Mostly due
to caring about browsers, caring about finding the right polyfill, old versions of IE, Css hacks
and generally what I consider to be a never ending barrage of bullshit that regular users are
shielded from, but developers must be constantly aware of. This to me, makes forward facing tech
on the web irritating, arbitrarily hard and not worth it. However, since this is just a thing I'm
doing for me and I don't care what browser where renders what in some way, I decided to give the
whole html5 Css thing another go.
</p>

<p>
So I started with what I sort of remembered, I need to reset or something, and then I found that
apparently lots of people are normalizing instead. Grabbed <a href="https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss">this</a> scss version of <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a>. Now
where do I find just some good stuff, you know what I mean, a sensible base layer. Poking around and
a wild <a href="http://getskeleton.com">skeleton</a> appeared, then I located <a href="https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes/Skeleton-Sass">this</a> scss version which had the normalize removed, what luck
since i had already found the standalone one.
</p>

<p>
At first I was messing around with the skeleton grid system, pretty sweet, but when I was exploring
I kept hearing about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a> is coming soon, so I looked into this flexy box thing. Turns out it had
arrived already. With this knowledge in hand I quickly located <a href="http://flexboxgrid.com">flexbox grid</a> and disabled importing
the grid system from skeleton. Nice nice, great start. Then I found out that chrome dropped support
for position: sticky, messed around with java script polyfills for making this work. Then I decided
meh who cares. With that tidbit out of the way, I moved on to colors. Even though I generally
dislike frontend work I have always loved colors, which gave me another chance to use one of my favorite
tools <a href="http://sipapp.io">sip</a>, very cool. So I snagged me some colors, and got to work.
</p>

<p>
Type type type, messing around with template, soooo many divs and divs as wrappers barf. I thought
this was <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/come-on-it-s-2015-current-year">&gt;Current Year</a> and there was supposed to be much semantic goodness. Much searching, find some
examples. Strip down the html present in my starting template, omg all the shapes and typesetting are
three kinds of messed up. Ok&#x2026;Ok&#x2026;Gonna bite the bullet lets strip this whole thing down, use
reference render of decent looking one rendered old way. Ok some sections an aside a nav and various
elements later, done. So I'm looking at it and I'm pretty unsatisfied with my navigation, and I think
to myself yeah, code. It should look like code.
</p>

<p>
Great idea, I get to work on it manually plotting out some spans, simulate rainbow parenthesis. But there
is this huge gap at the bottom of my code block. What gives? Turns out that the end of the liquid for
tag before the closing &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; adds white space as it is interpreted literally. So I had
to capture the output:
</p>

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% capture nav_links %}
{% assign line_num = 2 %}
{% assign pages_list = site.pages %}
{% assign filtered_list = site.array %}
{% for item in pages_list %}
{% if item.title != null %}
{% if item.layout == "page" %}
{% assign filtered_list = filtered_list | push: item %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% for node in filtered_list %}
{% assign line_num = line_num | plus: 1 %}
{% if forloop.last == true %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
and insert it:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}{{ nav_links | downcase }}</code></pre></nav>{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Instead of keeping the logic in between the tags, as it had originally been done in BlackDoc.
</p>

<p>
Alright, then I noticed that for some reason (still unknown to me) if you visit <a href="https://dotmilk.github.io/bug">this</a> bugged archived
copy of the main page. You will discover the thing that prompted me to ask <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/39337638/2180406">this</a> question on SO. Basically
for some reason on safari the left hand nav is thin and anti-aliased while the pagination at the bottom
is not. I followed the advice, well sort of because I wanted both navigation places to look like the
pagination. Now I just need to style the tags on the main article pages and should be done, unless
I totally forgot about something. Probably did&#x2026;probably did.</p>
