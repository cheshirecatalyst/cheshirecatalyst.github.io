So, turns out since I'm strange and just push my _live to master and the rest
of it to the 'sources' branch, none of the hooks get called until I push sources
which is fine I just hadn't thought about it and was like where are my comments.
It is mostly my own fault for not thinking and also being difficult. I mean,
had I really thought about it of course the git hook is looking through the
_posts directory not 2016/xx/xx/xxxxxx. So with this issue resolved hopefully
this push will do what I think it should and I wont have to call bootstrap and
push with the script to make it work.</p>
