That thing I just did, has started to be extremely helpful as far as <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
and my total <a href="https://emacswiki.org/">Emacs</a> experience. Well&#x2026;what is "That thing I just did"? Funny
you should ask me that as I just discovered a thing 'C-c l' <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-links.html">org-store-link</a> as
I was trying to just insert the Emacs link above and forgot to keep 'C' down
for the 'C-c C-l'. Sure it was a diversion but I welcome temporary digressions
to a certain depth while engaged in my day to day activities. It's basically
like the <a href="https://xkcd.com/214/">problem</a> with Wikipedia. Except for in Emacs, it's minutes of fascinated
'C-h k' which tells me wtf this key combo does or 'C-h v' which tells me wtf this
variable is and how it relates to the largely unknown mesh of abstractions that
let me type stuff like this.
</p>

<p>
However I too have digressed, but not really. I just wrote about something I just
found out about, a feature of this thing I am writing this blog in which will
come in handy, and already had when I started using it and writing about the time
I discovered easy link creation while making <a href="/2016/07/31/new-blog">this other</a> post&#x2026;

While the above pyramid has seen more than its fair share of use and abuse, certainly
a few of those items above will really help you and a different or overlapping set
will help someone else. For instance I have really been digging on <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a>
for my contrived experiences, which completing the elixir (I had them all done,
they have since added more) and common lisp problems in Emacs has given me direct
purposeful experience with Emacs. Say you are all about <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and have your actual
work, workflow all set up there, and you've heard about this Emacs thing. Well
you can keep your purposeful experience in atom (do your work there) and play with
contrived experiences in your preferred or new language in Emacs while getting
purposeful experience with it.

Now I add a new layer in by blogging about my experience from inside one of the
technologies I have used to edit all parts of this blog. Which if I point out things
tips tricks chords then this .org file I'm blogging from also becomes a sort of
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Worst_100_Self_Help_books_of_All_Time">self-help</a> <a href="http://www.core-vector.net/files/redcode_cheatsheet.pdf">cheat-sheet</a>. Which is to say getting this blog going in a single file
has come with other unexpected benefits.
