Ok Ok ok&#x2026;that is a horrible joke, however it is now apparently open season on
comments thanks to a pretty cool <a href="https://github.com/wireddown/ghpages-ghcomments">hack</a>, all nicely packaged with wonderful and
concise instructions <a href="http://downtothewire.io/ghpages-ghcomments/setup/">here</a>, and so far this seems to work. It very nicely added
the appropriate stuff for existing posts and this post will mark the test of
its hook functionality. Hoping it all works as advertised.
