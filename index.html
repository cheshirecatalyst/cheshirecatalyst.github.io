    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2016</span>

    <p>
Today I started on a new mutli-pronged adventure. Ok, well most of those
prongs all revolve around <a href="https://emacswiki.org/">emacs</a>. Which is a cool looking and fun program in general.
So this adventure began when I decided to graduate from using it for editing
commit messages, and try to use it exclusively. Thus this blog is born.
</p>


<p>
It's a pretty hefty task getting all the things how you want them, learning all
the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord">chords</a> sorting through similar yet frustratingly different problems and
solutions. This struggle in and of itself, helps the learner on many levels.
</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
Did this work? I hope it did. And it did. Which is nice since I've never even touched
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> before. In fact while writing that line I got sick of manually typing in
square brackets and looked up the chord for 'org-insert-link' 'C-c C-l', which
took many keystrokes to hunt down, however over time the initial investment of
a few extra keystrokes is certainly worth never having to type those square brackets
again unless I just R E A L L Y wanted to. It seems I have digressed, I was excited
because the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html#Easy-templates">easy templates</a> feature I read about to make a code block and see if it
was indeed exported as html worked. That is both the feature and the translation to
a code block in the output.
</p>

<p>
I will cover this process more in depth in the future, but for now I am just stoked
this is all working, and glad I put the initial effort into emacs to reach the
critical mass point where it all (at least to me) seems to start coming together.</p>
