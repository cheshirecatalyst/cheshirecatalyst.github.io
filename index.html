    <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2016</span>
    <p>
Time for a little more meat and potatoes with this milk. What really inspired me
to start this blog was a <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/how-i-blog-one-year-of-posts-in-a-single-org-file.html">post</a> I came across. I must admit the idea of keeping my
blog in a single file sounded extremely sexy, so armed with this article I googled
my way to this point. All without ever having used org-mode at all or realizing
org-mode is like some sort of strange markdown it seems like. And now I am hooked.
</p>
<p>
So the wtf:
</p>
<p>
Apparently I had messed up some property or a tag in combination with something
funky in jekyll. Which somehow was getting blog posts for today rendered tomorrow.
No idea, I opened a talk thing over with the jekyll folks, ran through a bunch of
rm -rf, changed stuff, ended up removing all the properties added by the
endless/export-to-blog to my sub headings and running the command again, and some
how through all of that ::prezto:: it was working.
</p>
<p>
I think it really started when I noticed that my eagerness to write stuff and post
had resulted in multiple posts for today and they were out of order so I hit up the
google magic and located an old github <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/30">issue</a> and it seemed to be fixed. So that was
nice however I realized the problem was with the script I had found on previously
mentioned blog SO&#x2026; I did a quick hack and somewhere after that it broke, then
it fixed itself. I think it had to do with updating posts that had already been
marked by the script with a file name or something I dunno. Long story short&#x2026;
"Too late!" I undid my hack and polished it up a bit and submitted a pull request
for great justice.
</p>
<p>
In case my shit code is shit and not merge worthy here is my <a href="https://github.com/cheshirecatalyst/ox-jekyll-subtree">version</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/ox-jekyll-subtree">original</a> by author of previously mentioned blog. I would check the original
first to see if merged or perhaps he wrote it in a better way. Though I assume
very few people are posting multiple times a day from org-mode using his handy
helper, but I'm continuously wrong, so we shall see.

And now (hopefully) I have my google analytics up and running thanks to this
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/36797554">answer</a> which is further explained in <a href="https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/">this</a> blog post by aforementioned answerer.
Many thanks to him, and those working on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. I am really starting to appreciate
the stack as it is extremely intuitive and well documented. While they aren't really
in competition as they are for completely different domains, I consider jekyll to be
another great victory in the non-rails ruby web tech area.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I almost forgot many thanks to <a href="http://web-mode.org/">web-mode</a> which I just found, as i was getting
tired of seeing all sorts of funky errors in my .html from the jekyll templating
and such. This particular snippet after installation worked wonders:
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">&#39;auto-mode-alist</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;\\.html?\\&#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">web-mode</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
Also useful was this <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Languages.html">list</a> of supported languages in <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html">literal</a> blocks with org-mode.

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2016</span>
    <p>
So here is a useful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28249255/how-do-i-configure-github-to-use-non-supported-jekyll-site-plugins/28252200#28252200">tidbit</a> I came across while setting this whole thing up. I
suppose it is somewhat old news to some, however I am new to the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>
game and haven't looked at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">jekyll</a> since 2010-ish. That last bit is entirely my
fault though, as I had left <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-land</a> at that point and was off in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">v8-world</a>
until recently. When I quit my job and moved back to the united states. Crazy
I know.
</p>
<p>
So after catching up on <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">serial</a>, and getting back in to drawing, I finally got
to the point where I could look at code again. It was here as previously
mentioned that I got heavily into emacs. Which admittedly was less for the
sake of blogging, and more because I had finally committed to get more than
a passing familiarity with <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">cl</a>. Which meant spending time in emacs and <a href="https://github.com/slime/slime">slime</a>
and the more time I spent in emacs the more I found out it can <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TheKitchenSink">do</a>. This, I am
almost certain, is an age-old story of emacs addiction. I wonder if there is
a 12 step program for this?</p>

  <div class="post">

    <p>
Today I started on a new multi-pronged adventure. Ok, well most of those
prongs all revolve around <a href="https://emacswiki.org/">Emacs</a>. Which is a cool looking and fun program in general.
So this adventure began when I decided to graduate from using it for editing
commit messages, and try to use it exclusively. Thus this blog is born.
</p>
<p>
It's a pretty hefty task getting all the things how you want them, learning all
the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord">chords</a> sorting through similar yet frustratingly different problems and
solutions. This struggle in and of itself, helps the learner on many levels.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>
Did this work? I hope it did. And it did. Which is nice since I've never even touched
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> before. In fact while writing that line I got sick of manually typing in
square brackets and looked up the chord for 'org-insert-link' 'C-c C-l', which
took many keystrokes to hunt down, however over time the initial investment of
a few extra keystrokes is certainly worth never having to type those square brackets
again unless I just R E A L L Y wanted to. It seems I have digressed, I was excited
because the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html#Easy-templates">easy</a> feature I read about to make a code block and see if it
was indeed exported as html worked. That is both the feature and the translation to
a code block in the output.
</p>
<p>
I will cover this process more in depth in the future, but for now I am just stoked
this is all working, and glad I put the initial effort into Emacs to reach the
critical mass point where it all (at least to me) seems to start coming together.</p>
