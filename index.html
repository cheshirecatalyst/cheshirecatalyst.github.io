So a year or so ago, I purchased an e-book version of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action">Elixir in Action</a> after
having run through most of <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com">Learn You Some Erlang</a> and discovering <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> which
I instantly fell in love with but had no immediate use for. Not wanting to
leverage this awesome thing I just found solely (or at all really) as yet another
web framework, I did not dive right in to <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> and still have yet to. So I
needed something to sate my desire to ingrain Elixir into my brain. After 20 or
so exercises on <a href="http://exercism.io/languages/elixir">exercism.io</a> I looked for some book action to learn the finer
points of all things not Phoenix.
</p>
<p>
Enter 'Elixir in action', great book. Loved it, soft intro and gets deeper quickly.
However, on my kindle keyboard, the oft used images of code, instead of text
elsewhere in the book, are way too faded and low contrast and fail to show up
in a reasonable and readable manner. So I downloaded <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com">calibre</a> to see what damage
I could do, as I know nothing about e-books at all. After a few failed conversions
to what calibre considers an editable format, failed as in, I didn't like how the
text looked after putting it back on the kindle. I went ahead and just opened the
book editor, woo a simple image editor, normalize and sharpen looks good. Almost
300 images and no bulk apply to all images feature I could find&#x2026; WELLLLLL
</p>
<p>
Then I shifted to converting it to a zip <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to the rescue.
</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mogrify -level 50x100% *.jpeg</code></pre></figure>
<p>
Converted it into an azw3. Place on kindle, massive text formatting problems. Ok Ok
I think to myself must be a good way of going about this. Locate calibre plugin
for KindleUnpack, discover it is a wrapper locate the appropriate repo <a href="https://github.com/kevinhendricks/KindleUnpack">here</a>. Unpack
the original book, do that ImageMagick, have calibre build me an azw3. Sigh, much less
in the horrible text department, but still I would consider unreadable, those images tho.
Ok Ok time to dive into some more conversion options
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Disable font size rescaling
</li>
<li>Use Cybook G3 output and input profile as the resolution is right for my kindle
</li>
<li>Replace detect chapters at Xpath with /
</li>
<li>Replace insert page breaks before Xpath with /
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hit blend&#x2026;.BAM a readable book text and images all looking pretty good. Mission
success. Now I can finally get through chapter 5 after brushing back through chapter 4
and finish a book I bought forever ago.

So I have spent the last two weeks or so ripping parts out of <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> and learning about
minor mode creation and pretty much all the things I never never got around to checking
out. I think perhaps most of it was fear, and a little bit of lazy / lack of need /
want. A large part of this was due to <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> and how it just worked, and still works. It
just had fulfilled its purpose in being an introduction to the way things could be in
Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Basically I had gotten tired of throwing stuff in my personal directory and had a growing
file of thigns to work around features of prelude or adding funcitnality. One day it was too
much and I set about figuring what parts of prelude did what and why. Much was learned about
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html">hooks</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advising</a> functions

<li>basic <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/core/prelude-mode.el">minor</a> mode creation
</li>
<li>some <a href="https://github.com/tonini/alchemist.el/blob/master/alchemist.el#L115">keymap</a> fun
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm sure there is much more, and that future posts will go into greater details.
For now though. Phew&#x2026;..

This is mostly just a test running a diagnostic thing to see what is going on.
Which turned out to be maybe a heisenbug, because as soon as i turned on the
diagnostics it suddenly works. Yay&#x2026;ish.

So, turns out since I'm strange and just push my _live to master and the rest
of it to the 'sources' branch, none of the hooks get called until I push sources
which is fine I just hadn't thought about it and was like where are my comments.
It is mostly my own fault for not thinking and also being difficult. I mean,
had I really thought about it of course the git hook is looking through the
_posts directory not 2016/xx/xx/xxxxxx. So with this issue resolved hopefully
this push will do what I think it should and I wont have to call bootstrap and
push with the script to make it work.
</p>
<p>
Update: Wellllllll still no joy on the hooks. they have been +x and all that jazz
so I have left a comment on an old <a href="https://github.com/wireddown/ghpages-ghcomments/issues/6">issue</a> hopefully something good will come from it
luckily I can still manually create them with two commands when I publish a post.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time I will dig through this script and see what gives.

That thing I just did, has started to be extremely helpful as far as <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
and my total <a href="https://emacswiki.org/">Emacs</a> experience. Well&#x2026;what is "That thing I just did"? Funny
you should ask me that as I just discovered a thing 'C-c l' <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-links.html">org-store-link</a> as
I was trying to just insert the Emacs link above and forgot to keep 'C' down
for the 'C-c C-l'. Sure it was a diversion but I welcome temporary digressions
to a certain depth while engaged in my day to day activities. It's basically
like the <a href="https://xkcd.com/214/">problem</a> with Wikipedia. Except for in Emacs, it's minutes of fascinated
'C-h k' which tells me wtf this key combo does or 'C-h v' which tells me wtf this
variable is and how it relates to the largely unknown mesh of abstractions that
let me type stuff like this.
</p>
<p>
However I too have digressed, but not really. I just wrote about something I just
found out about, a feature of this thing I am writing this blog in which will
come in handy, and already had when I started using it and writing about the time
I discovered easy link creation while making <a href="/2016/07/31/new-blog">this other</a> post&#x2026;
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/public/images/lpyramid.jpg" alt="lpyramid.jpg" />
</p>
</div>
<p>
While the above pyramid has seen more than its fair share of use and abuse, certainly
a few of those items above will really help you and a different or overlapping set
will help someone else. For instance I have really been digging on <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a>
for my contrived experiences, which completing the elixir (I had them all done,
they have since added more) and common lisp problems in Emacs has given me direct
purposeful experience with Emacs. Say you are all about <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and have your actual
work, workflow all set up there, and you've heard about this Emacs thing. Well
you can keep your purposeful experience in atom (do your work there) and play with
contrived experiences in your preferred or new language in Emacs while getting
purposeful experience with it.
</p>
<p>
Now I add a new layer in by blogging about my experience from inside one of the
technologies I have used to edit all parts of this blog. Which if I point out things
tips tricks chords then this .org file I'm blogging from also becomes a sort of
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Worst_100_Self_Help_books_of_All_Time">self-help</a> <a href="http://www.core-vector.net/files/redcode_cheatsheet.pdf">cheat-sheet</a>. Which is to say getting this blog going in a single file
has come with other unexpected benefits.
