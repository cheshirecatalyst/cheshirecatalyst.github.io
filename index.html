    <p>So when I got started with this blog, I grabbed the first thing that I saw I liked and was good to go, out of the box. That happened to be BlackDoc. I did this mainly so I could experiment with Emacs and blogging from it through jekyll, also I generally despise any 'front-end' work. Mostly due to caring about browsers, caring about finding the right polyfill, old versions of IE, Css hacks and generally what I consider to be a never ending barrage of bullshit that regular users are shielded from, but developers must be constantly aware of. This to me, makes forward facing tech on the web irritating, arbitrarily hard and not worth it. However, since this is just a thing I'm doing for me and I don't care what browser where renders what in some way, I...</p>

    <p>So a year or so ago, I purchased an e-book version of Elixir in Action after having run through most of Learn You Some Erlang and discovering Elixir which I instantly fell in love with but had no immediate use for. Not wanting to leverage this awesome thing I just found solely (or at all really) as yet another web framework, I did not dive right in to Phoenix and still have yet to. So I needed something to sate my desire to ingrain Elixir into my brain. After 20 or so exercises on exercism.io I looked for some book action to learn the finer points of all things not Phoenix. Enter 'Elixir in action', great book. Loved it, soft intro and gets deeper quickly. However, on my kindle keyboard, the oft used images of code, instead of text elsewhere...</p>

    <p>So I have spent the last two weeks or so ripping parts out of Prelude and learning about minor mode creation and pretty much all the things I never never got around to checking out. I think perhaps most of it was fear, and a little bit of lazy / lack of need / want. A large part of this was due to Prelude and how it just worked, and still works. It just had fulfilled its purpose in being an introduction to the way things could be in Emacs. Basically I had gotten tired of throwing stuff in my personal directory and had a growing file of thigns to work around features of prelude or adding funcitnality. One day it was too much and I set about figuring what parts of prelude did what and why. Much was learned...</p>

This is mostly just a test running a diagnostic thing to see what is going on.
Which turned out to be maybe a heisenbug, because as soon as i turned on the
diagnostics it suddenly works. Yay&#x2026;ish.

    <p>So, turns out since I'm strange and just push my _live to master and the rest of it to the 'sources' branch, none of the hooks get called until I push sources which is fine I just hadn't thought about it and was like where are my comments. It is mostly my own fault for not thinking and also being difficult. I mean, had I really thought about it of course the git hook is looking through the _posts directory not 2016/xx/xx/xxxxxx. So with this issue resolved hopefully this push will do what I think it should and I wont have to call bootstrap and push with the script to make it work. Update: Wellllllll still no joy on the hooks. they have been +x and all that jazz so I have left a comment on an old issue hopefully...</p>
