Time for a little more meat and potatoes with this milk. What really inspired me
to start this blog was a <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/how-i-blog-one-year-of-posts-in-a-single-org-file.html">post</a> I came across. I must admit the idea of keeping my
blog in a single file sounded extremely sexy, so armed with this article I googled
my way to this point. All without ever having used org-mode at all or realizing
org-mode is like some sort of strange markdown it seems like. And now I am hooked.
</p>
<p>
So the wtf:
</p>
<p>
Apparently I had messed up some property or a tag in combination with something
funky in jekyll. Which somehow was getting blog posts for today rendered tomorrow.
No idea, I opened a talk thing over with the jekyll folks, ran through a bunch of
rm -rf, changed stuff, ended up removing all the properties added by the
endless/export-to-blog to my sub headings and running the command again, and some
how through all of that ::prezto:: it was working.
</p>
<p>
I think it really started when I noticed that my eagerness to write stuff and post
had resulted in multiple posts for today and they were out of order so I hit up the
google magic and located an old github <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/30">issue</a> and it seemed to be fixed. So that was
nice however I realized the problem was with the script I had found on previously
mentioned blog SO&#x2026; I did a quick hack and somewhere after that it broke, then
it fixed itself. I think it had to do with updating posts that had already been
marked by the script with a file name or something I dunno. Long story short&#x2026;
"Too late!" I undid my hack and polished it up a bit and submitted a pull request
for great justice.
</p>
<p>
In case my shit code is shit and not merge worthy here is my <a href="https://github.com/cheshirecatalyst/ox-jekyll-subtree">version</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/ox-jekyll-subtree">original</a> by author of previously mentioned blog. I would check the original
first to see if merged or perhaps he wrote it in a better way. Though I assume
very few people are posting multiple times a day from org-mode using his handy
helper, but I'm continuously wrong, so we shall see.
