So here is a useful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28249255/how-do-i-configure-github-to-use-non-supported-jekyll-site-plugins/28252200#28252200">tidbit</a> I came across while setting this whole thing up. I
suppose it is somewhat old news to some, however I am new to the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>
game and haven't looked at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">jekyll</a> since 2010-ish. That last bit is entirely my
fault though, as I had left <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-land</a> at that point and was off in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">v8-world</a>
until recently.
